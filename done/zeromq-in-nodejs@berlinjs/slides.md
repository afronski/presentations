- My name is Wojtek Gawro≈Ñski (@afronski). I am a part of a rspective team.
- We are a pragmatic software house based in Katowice, Poland, but we also have an office in Berlin - we are here at least once in a month.
- We are working mostly with start-ups - couple of them are from here, couple are not.
- But we also working with bigger companies, like e.g. SAS institute.
- Instead only retrieving from community, we are also giving back - we are regularly organizing NodeSchool Silesia, we are bootstrapping other meet-ups in the Silesian region, and also we are cooperating with local Hackerspace community.
- Enough of this - let's go to the details!

# Agenda

### Our Use Case
### Brief overview what ZeroMQ is
### Diving into small case study

???

- I always want to present something real. So I will start with describing our use case.
- Then, we will fluently talk about the capabilities and features of ZeroMQ, we will briefly talk about pattern language defined there.
- And after that we will see how the actual implementation looked like and with what kind of challenges we have dealt.

# Our Use Case

???

- I can't disclose too many details regarding domain or the actual algorithms, but I promise that the technical side related with ZeroMQ and Node.js is gathered 1:1 from the actual problem.
